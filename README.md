## List of Tasks:
1. Fetch a list of posts from an api and display them in a simple tabular format
2. Place an add button on top of the table which will open a form when clicked
3. On the form create basic input fields
   For posts there will be two text inputs (title,body)
4. POST the user input to the server and append those details to the table on successful 
   response
5. Error handling in case of bad server response , can show a message on the top that
   adding a post failed
   
Public api used:
  GET, POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


## Explanation:
We have three files wherein one file contains all the html code, the other is a javascript file which is used for interaction with the API and performs error handling checks and the last one is the css file. All these files work in sync and hence fulfill all of the above mentioned tasks.
